# Monero Merchant Resources

Monero Outreach suggests using the phrase _We Accept Monero_ instead of following Bitcoin’s pattern with _Monero Accepted Here_. It’s just a subtle shift in phrasing, but it puts the focus on people, people thinking about money in new way.

We have created _We Accept Monero_ files so you can create stickers and signs announcing that you accept Monero. We’ve created templates for some common sizes, but you can customize to fit your needs. Additionally the vector files are suitable for making die-cut stickers, 2D laser etching or online as an svg icon. These files are release under Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0). Use and share and be well.

All of the templates below use Google’s Noto Sans Bold font since it provides glyph support for almost the entire world. It’s free to use and your localized version can be downloaded from [google.com/get/noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/).

### _We Accept Monero Stickers & Signs_
---

These sticker templates are based on common label sizes that you can find at your local office supply store and print with your own inkjet. Your local print shop would also be able to help you. For exterior applications where you have direct sunlight or direct moisture you’ll be better off contacting a local sign company. This will be a simple job for them and you’ll get something that will last in the weather.

Our template here is a starting place, you have the opportunity to customize it with your look and your message. If you’re unfamilar with graphic design software these files may seem foreign. If so, seek reccommendations for a local graphic designer or post an ad on [reddit.com/r/moneromarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/moneromarket/) and hire a designer from the Monero community.

You will need to generate the QR code for your Monero address so that customer can scan with their mobile wallet. Use [the-qrcode-generator.com](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) or your favorite QR code generator to input your address and generate your QR code file. The svg file format is ideal for printing clearly, avoid .jpgs or .pngs where possible.

The backside of this counter display has room for you to write your store’s process for accepting XMR. You can leave notes for yourself and for your staff so that every Monero transaction goes smoothly.

These templates will fit on 8.5" x 14 (Legal) paper and you can print this yourself. For a piece like this a cardstock, commonly called ‘100 lb cover’ is recommended. This paper is about the thickness of an index card and a local print shop should be able to produce it inexpensively.
