# Monero Merchant FAQs

When starting out, everyone runs into questions. We’ve answered some of the most commonly asked questions here, and we’d like to hear additional questions and answer them here for others.

### _Will accepting Monero increase my sales?_

Maybe, probably, but it won’t be a silver bullet. There is a strong Monero community that believes in supporting merchants that accept Monero, there are opportunities to have a conversation with your customers about what you’re doing to protect their privacy. It will depend on what you make of it. Historically accepting crypto has tended to pay off, Coindesk did a 2014 survey [coindesk.com/survey-results-one-fourth-of-bitcoin-merchants-enjoy-10-sales-boost](https://www.coindesk.com/survey-results-one-fourth-of-bitcoin-merchants-enjoy-10-sales-boost) that found 25% of new Bitcoin merchants saw a 10% increase in sales. More recently, in 2018 CreditCoin’s survey [prnewswire.com/news...study-shows-complicated-purchasing-process-is-biggest-hurdle-for-cryptocurrencies...html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-study-shows-complicated-purchasing-process-is-biggest-hurdle-for-cryptocurrencies-300674527.html) found that 75% of crypto holders would like to be able to spend cryptocurreny in brick-and-mortar stores. Lastly, with lower fees and simpler international purchases you can expect a wider range of prospective customers if your business is digital or mail-order.

### _How is accepting Monero different from accepting Bitcoin?_

Setting up to accept Bitcoin or Monero would be similar, but the blockchains behave differently. Some of Monero’s unique features of particular interest to retailers:

- **Faster Payment** - Monero has a 2 minute block-time compared to Bitcoin’s 10 minute blocks. As a result, on average your transaction will reach the Monero blockchain 5x faster than Bitcoin.
- **Less Expensive** - Monero has much lower transaction fees than Bitcoin and as Monero continues to become more efficient, the trend has been for fees to go lower.
- **No Delayed Transactions** - Monero has a dynamic block-size while Bitcoin’s is fixed. When the Bitcoin network is busy and the blocks are filled transactions must either pay higher fees or be delayed.
- **Risk-Free** - Because Monero is private all the time and therefore, fungible, no one can discriminate against the coin’s history. Tainted Bitcoin is a growing problem for merchants, but Monero has no such problem.

### _How do Monero fees compare to credit cards?_

With Monero, the sender pays the network fee. It will always be completely free to accept XMR. It would currently cost your customer about $0.02 to pay with Monero. Paying with Monero will be much less expensive than a credit card transaction in addition to settling faster.

|--|--|--|--|--|
| Processing Fee | 2.5% - 3.5% | 1.55% - 2.6% | 1.43% - 2.4% | 0.30% - 2.75% |
| Interchange Fee | -- | 0.08% | 0.09% | 0.05% + $0.21 0.70% + $0.15 |
| Network Fee | 0.15% | 0.08% | 0.09% | 0.75% - 0.90% |
| Switch Fee | -- | -- | -- | $0.025 - $0.075 |
| Fees for $10 Purchase | **$0.27 - $0.37** | **$0.18 - $0.28** | **$0.16 - $0.26** | **$0.35 - $0.66** |
| Fees for $100 Purchase | **$2.65 - $6.65** | **$1.78 - $2.83** | **$1.61 - $2.58** | **$3.45 - $6.60** |
| Fees for $1,000 Purchase | **$26.50 - $66.50** | **$17.80 - $28.30** | **$16.10 - $25.80** | **$34.50 - $66.00** |

Merchant fees for debit/credit transactions will vary by your type of business and your processor but a Monero transaction will be between 7x and 3023x less expensive than a debit/credit transaction.

You may also have to pay additional fees if the the card number is entered manually, or if the debit card is swiped or if it’s an international transaction. You may also have additional monthly or annual fees from your payment processing provider.

### _Are Monero transactions less expensive than Bitcoin?_

As complex as the credit/debit cards are, the fees tends to be regular. The Interchange Rate is regulated by law and updated twice a year. By comparison, Bitcoin fees are anything but regular and increase when the network is busy. Monero has had very low and stable transaction fees since introducing Bulletproofs in 2018.

Bitcoin fees are in constant flux, this chart was drawn from [bitinfocharts.com/comparison...fees-btc-xmr...](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-xmr-sma7.html#1y) but for a better sense of BTC/XMR fees at any given moment, [monero.how/monero-transaction-fees](https://www.monero.how/monero-transaction-fees) maintains highs, lows and averages for the last 100 tx on each network.

### _Is there a simple way to automatically convert the customer’s XMR into fiat?_

Most third-party payment processors allow you to choose your settlement currency, including fiat. Our [Monero Payment Processors Guide](https://www.monerooutreach.org/merchants/monero-payment-processor-guide.html) provides more details on that. If you are using a self-hosted payment processor or accepting payment just with a wallet, you would need to use your preferred exchange and their API to convert.

### _How do I report this income on my taxes?_

You’ll want to seek advice from your accountant or tax advisor. Most of the time the purchase will be calculated in your local fiat so that your accounting is in order and sales tax is being applied properly. Then that total purchase amount would be converted into XMR based on the current exchange rate. This sort of process is common in border towns for businesses accepting currencies from both countries. The transaction is recorded in your local fiat first and then the conversion is figured out. Once you've been paid in XMR and the customer has taken their goods, you would just have the normal taxable events if you traded that XMR or exchanged it for fiat. This second tax event isn’t unique to a crypto transaction, even a credit card transaction may create an additional tax event depending on how you dispurse the funds.
