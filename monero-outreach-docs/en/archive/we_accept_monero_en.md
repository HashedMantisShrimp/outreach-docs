# We Accept Monero

**“Are you tired of praying for adoption? Sick of waiting for a Monero moon to rise? Be the change you want to see in the ecosystem.” - 20th of May, 2020**

We’d like to invite you to join our efforts in perpetrating a good old-fashioned ‘nag campaign’ with your favorite merchants who don’t accept XMR yet. The most awesome, and the most successful ‘nag campaign’ of all time had to have been written by George Lois. In 1982 the cable companies had no interest in a 24-hour music channel, they didn’t think it would work. George Lois came up with an idea and shot a series of commercials that had rock stars telling the viewers to call their local cable company and say “I Want My MTV!” The rest is history, [youtu.be/vAyOcWpm3QU](https://youtu.be/vAyOcWpm3QU?t=71).

The mission, should you choose to accept it, is to contact your favorite merchant and ask them if they’ve considered accepting Monero, because that would be your preferred method of payment. They might say yes, they might say no, but at least you’ve made them think about it. It won’t be the last time they hear about Monero, but it might be their first.

Conventional wisdom in marketing says that someone needs to see a message seven times before they actually become aware of it. That's a rule of thumb for advertising, but we're hoping to encourage a conversation with merchants. One good conversation is easily worth seven ad hits. Research has found that people who know an organization are five times more likely to have a favorable opinion of it. In other words, the more you talk about Monero, the more people will like it.

We’ve also created this dollar bill sized brochure that you can print out and put in your wallet when you’re out in the world. This piece focuses on the three unique features of Monero that are most important to small business owners and invites them to learn more on our [Monero Merchant Services](https://www.monerooutreach.org/merchants/) pages.
