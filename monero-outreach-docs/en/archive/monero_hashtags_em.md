**Hashtags help your Monero Tweets to be seen. - 26th of December, 2020**

How many times have you gotten up in the morning to find #Bitcoin trending on Twitter and not #Monero? As tempting as it sounds, we’re not going to talk about _trying_ to make #Monero trend, rather we’ll just go over some things to speed along the day when it does and communicate more effectivly in the meantime.

By default, the trending topics you see on Twitter are determined by an algorithm based on who you follow, your interests, and your location. It’s in this personalized trend feed where #Monero would be mostly likely to appear. Additionally, Twitter editorializes trends and manually selects the representative Tweet for the trend. The algorithm prioritizes what they call ‘emerging topics’ and demote trends that have been popular for a while or that your account has seen multiple times; total hashtag volume is just part of the equation. Lastly, they filter heavily against all manner of spammy behavior or content that violates their rules and will supress them from the search results.

**“Amazes me how many forget #Monero in their tweets. Out of sight out of mind.”

Beyond the community milestone of #Monero trending and the new audience it would bring, using hashtags helps people find your content. Do a quick test in Twitter, search for ‘monero’ and then search for ‘#monero’ to see for yourself where your Tweet will show up. #XMR is another commonly used hashtag, especially among traders as XMR is the ticker symbol, but is often used as shorthand for Monero as well. More specific hashtags help organize relevant content within the community for releases like #OxygenOrion, events like #MoneroKonferenco or can just be a slogan like #MoneroMeansMoney.

Twitter hashtags can appear anywhere in your Tweet so long as they don't contain spaces or punctuation. If you’re not in the habit of using hashtags, the simplest way to start is to just replace words that you’re already using with a hashtag.

Using many hashtags will often backfire as your post may look more spammy and be more difficult to read. Twitter suggests using two hashtags and while there doesn’t appear to be a direct penalty for using more, it does seem that Twitter’s algo is designed to reduce spam and promote quality content. It’s a fair guess that hashtag count would be something they’re evaluating. For best results, pick a couple of the most important words, words that you think someone else might search for, and make sure they are present as hashtags.

One other way that you can contribute: If you see a really great Monero Tweet that you’d like to Retweet but the author has forgotten to use hashtags, use the Retweet with Comment feature and add your own hashtags in your comment. It’s better if the Tweet itself contains the hashtags, but helping by adding your own is better than nothing.

Happy hashtagging!
