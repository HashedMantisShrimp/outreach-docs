# Discover Why Monero Attracts the Third Most Talent in all of Crypto

**Maybe developers know something the rest of us don’t. - 19th of September, 2020**

Of all the projects in crypto, Monero (XMR) ranks third by number of developers, led only by Bitcoin and Ethereum ([coingecko.com/en?view=developer](https://www.coingecko.com/en?view=developer) <-sort list by ‘contributors’). On a given day, the Monero network has about 15-20% the amount of publicly findable nodes as the Bitcoin network. (Compare [monerohash.com/nodes-distribution.html](https://monerohash.com/nodes-distribution.html) with [bitnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io/).) And yet, Monero only has 1% the market cap of Bitcoin. Why is that?

#### “Monero was built as a hedge against Bitcoin.”

It seems the most hardcore cryptocurrency enthusiasts might be aware of something the rest of us aren’t. You may have heard that Monero is the top privacy coin by market cap, or that it is becoming more widely used on darknet markets (a sign of adoption in Bitcoin’s early years), but there is more to Monero.

Known as a privacy coin by the wider crypto universe, Monero proponents prefer the label ‘anti-surveillance’ coin. This is a jab at the transparency that exists with Bitcoin and the ability for corporations and governments to easily trace Bitcoin transactions throughout the network and link them to real-life identities. In fact, everything about Monero was built as a hedge against Bitcoin.

Instead of believing transaction fees will keep the network alive long term, Monero uses ‘tail-emission’ to incentivize miners and keep transaction fees low, indefinitely. The supply inflation rate of Monero’s tail-emission is on par with the annual rate of new gold mined globally.

Remember the block size debate that led to Bitcoin splitting into Bitcoin Cash? That will likely never happen with Monero due to it’s scalable ‘dynamic block size’, which enables the block size to automatically increase or decrease depending on the amount of transactions happening on the network.

There has been confusion about Monero’s ability to be compliant with regulation. However, the lawyers at Coin Center assert that there is no need for regulators to crackdown on Monero and decentralized, open-source privacy coins ([coincenter.org/fincens-new-cryptocurrency-guidance-matches-coin-center-recommendations and coincenter.org/the-case-for-electronic-cash](https://www.coincenter.org/fincens-new-cryptocurrency-guidance-matches-coin-center-recommendations/)). And just last week, the international law firm Perkins Coie published a whitepaper asserting it is possible for regulated entities to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations when supporting privacy coins ([perkinscoie.com/...​/anti-money-laundering-regulation-of-privacy-enabling-cryptocurrencies.html](https://perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/anti-money-laundering-regulation-of-privacy-enabling-cryptocurrencies.html)).

Monero’s compliance features are also evident in the fact that Monero has been listed on Kraken and other US regulated exchanges for years now.

Due to its privacy features, government agencies have sought to ‘break’ Monero. CipherTrace is the recipient of millions of dollars from the Department of Homeland Security for trying to crack Monero’s encryption layers ([monerooutreach.org/news/ciphertrace-monero.html](https://www.monerooutreach.org/news/ciphertrace-monero.html)). The Internal Revenue Service has offered up $625,000 for someone to break Monero's privacy ([cointelegraph.com/news/xmr-workgroup-says-irs-should-study-monero-not-try-to-break-it](https://cointelegraph.com/news/xmr-workgroup-says-irs-should-study-monero-not-try-to-break-it)).

According to a spokesperson for Monero Outreach, this is a complete waste of time and taxpayer dollars, “the US government can just go on YouTube and view an extensive series featuring mathematicians and cryptographers from the Monero Research Lab (MRL) ([www.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab)) who work tirelessly trying to break Monero.” Ironically, or maybe not, the series they are referring to is known as ‘Breaking Monero’ ([youtube.com/watch?v=WOyC6OB6ezA&​list=PLsSYUeVwrHBnAUre2G_LYDsdo-tD0ov-y](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WOyC6OB6ezA&list=PLsSYUeVwrHBnAUre2G_LYDsdo-tD0ov-y)).

Researchers have spent years trying to break Monero, but according to Monero Outreach, “There are few groups in the world who understand Monero algorithms like the Monero Research Lab. If they haven’t broken Monero, we are not worried.” Immediately after CipherTrace announced the claim they could trace Monero transactions, a representative from MRL joined an interview with the CEO of CipherTrace to understand and effectively challenge the claims ([youtube.com/watch?v=w5rtd3md11g](https://youtube.com/watch?v=w5rtd3md11g)).

#### **“Monero is what everyone thought Bitcoin would grow up to be.”**

Monero has its own ecosystem that attracts contributors from throughout the world. It is often praised for its cypherpunk ethos, and to old Bitcoiners it is reminiscent of Bitcoin in the early days.

Monero Outreach reminds us, “Monero continues to upgrade the protocol based on audited research, and is to the point where a novice user can gain more confidence in privacy than a sophisticated Bitcoin user, all while having faster and cheaper transactions. At this point it would be foolish to ignore this legitimate Bitcoin hedge. Even novices can use Monero to store and transact wealth safely and privately.”

Maybe the hardcore cryptocurrency enthusiasts are right. Maybe we all should learn more about Monero.
