# Vaporware: How to Spot Bogus Claims

**Critical thinking tips when confronted with incredible claims. - 1st of July, 2021**

### By: Tepid Intrepid

On August 31st 2020, a crypto research company announced a Monero transaction tracing tool. If it worked, this would have been a monumental achievement. That day, the CEO conducted an interview with a Monero developer. Here is a time stamp to an insightful point in the discussion: [youtube.com/watch?v=w5rtd3md11g&t=402s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rtd3md11g&t=402s). In this exchange, I see the triumph of gentle and relentless pursuit of truth. If you are not an experienced developer (like myself), it’s hard to distinguish between software and vaporware. It’s clear now that the tool is vaporware, but it wasn’t at the time (to me at least). The following is a commentary on a lightly edited transcription of that interview.

**Moderator:** _“Can you talk about, specifically, what the tool can do right now?”._

**CEO:** _“It’s version one of the tool, there’s a roadmap of lots of things to do, but the tool does give you visual exploration, decoy elimination, probability scoring of inputs and outputs of transactions, allows you to assign risk to different addresses, and allows you to do case management of those addresses.”_

**Roadmap of things to do = appeal to future development**. Sometimes it’s okay say we’re working on it, but it’s a bad sign when the question is what can it do right now?

Let’s look at the second portion of the response: “visual exploration, decoy elimination, probability scoring, assigning risk to different addresses, case management.” This is an appeal to buzzwords. The CEO wants to establish himself as an expert by introducing terms with no agreed definition. This is a trap.

Vaporware lives and dies with buzzspeak. You cannot overcome it as a layman, almost by definition. It appears when the perception of a product is more important than the product itself. The entrepreneur finds a prospective investor, fails, adjusts his speech, and repeats. The process drifts towards a doppelganger of truth, which can only break upon contact with reality. Buzzspeak’s primary function is to avoid contact with reality. Read about Theranos to see an extreme example: [wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos).

**Developer:** _“Just to be clear, when you say addresses, are you referring to wallet addresses? or one time addresses that appear on the blockchain? In the Monero protocol, as you obviously know but maybe the listeners don’t, those things are mathematically differentiated in a big way. Without external information, sometimes significant external information, one time output addresses that appear on the blockchain are not inherently linkable to any wallet address, so which do you mean when you say that?”_

The developer’s question is an excellent response to buzzspeak. He knows how to pin it down, bring it into the language of true knowledge, and ask for clarification.

**CEO:** _“Wallet addresses. That’s correct, one time use addresses are generally not linkable, I mean the same is true on, to some extent on Bitcoin, unless somebody has actually sent money to it.”_

We have moved into the realm of true knowledge by using well defined terms. What is a one time use address? There are two possibilities. Monero uses stealth addresses, and Bitcoin uses invoice addresses. When he says “generally not linkable” and “the same is true on Bitcoin”, it’s clear he does not understand stealth address generation, a core feature of the Monero protocol.

**CEO:** _“Of course remember that I’m the CEO and not the head of the analysis team...we don’t want to share everything that we’re doing and how we do it. But we’ll do our best to tell you what we can.”_

**I’m not the head of the analysis team = appeal to authority**. You are supposed to be the authority. You’re the CEO of a crypto tracing company. You need to know the core features.

**We don’t want to share everything = appeal to secrecy**. You agree to the interview. You claim to crack Monero. You cannot describe the method nor provide evidence? C’mon man.

---

The rest of the interview continues like this. The developer steers the conversation towards true knowledge, and the CEO deflects. So what did I find in this interview?

I spotted these red flags:

- Appeal to future development
- Appeal to authority
- Appeal to secrecy
- Buzzspeak

And green flags:

- Relentless pursuit of truth
- Desire to avoid obfuscation
- Language of true knowledge

Internalize this kind of analysis and go poke around the landing page of other well known cryptocurrencies. What do you find? High octane, face-melting buzzspeak. Do you see flashy graphics? Are you a visionary? An innovator? Will you Change The World For The Better? Will You Save The Children? I’m not joking on that last one. It’s out there, and you don’t need to go far down the mArKeT cAp list to find it. I suspect interviews with these kinds of project leaders would resemble the above.

So why does crypto have so much nonsense floating around? Yes, there are fallacies and buzzspeak, but crypto has the unique appeal to price. This is a horrifying paradox. When the product is currency, it’s price (in theory) perfectly reflects the true value. But when you use the price as evidence for goodness, convincing others to buy literally makes the currency better (according to that logic). You can hit him with the fungibility jab, follow with the dynamic block size cross, and finish with a privacy by default uppercut. He falls to the ground. Victory. You stand over him, unsure if he’s conscious. He turns his head. You look into his eyes, he looks back. And whispers: number go up. The crowd goes wild.

Defeat! Is there no hope? Are we black-pilled forever? What is to be done?

To that I say, three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. Privacy is always last on the checklist, but it’s inevitable. SMS became popular in 2000, TextSecure in 2010, and now most messages are encrypted. Look how long it took to transition from http to https. The good news is that demand for privacy moves in one direction, the bad news is that it could be a while.
