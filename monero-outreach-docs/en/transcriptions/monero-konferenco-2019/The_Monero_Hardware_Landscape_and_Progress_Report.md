Thanks, Brandon. So, right, this is going to be a whirlwind tour of some of the most current devices that we're working on. We'll talk about two new devices, one is called Monero shield and one is called, and one is called Monero Metal. And then we'll see some wallets, see some current state of the wallets, including the enclosure. It's a PLA, polylactide 3d printed, and talk, maybe if we have time, about injection molding, which is on the roadmap as well. We'll take a look at badges at the end. 

So, basically what all of these devices are doing, what we kind of, our common goals, Monero hardware, is that they're storing secrets, and protecting them, controlling access to secret keys used to sign documents or to control access to spend keys so that we can spend our money wisely and safely. This is kind of a preview device now, it's called Monero Shield now but who knows what it will be called next year. Yeah, this thing is not very, maybe I'm too tall or the microphone's too short. So, and this is the way it looks, I just made a photo of it because I wasn't sure that this wonderful camera would work. What do you think of that? Let's focus, and this is the first-ever Monero shield device, it's a passive device it has no electronics. And it's basically an RF shield, it's a faraday cage. And I won't mention the other manufacturers of these but usually, the shield that shields the devices being worked on is about the size of a closet or a garage, costs four to seven hundred thousand euros, and can defeat EMP's, electro-magnetic pulses, so if you're in a city and you're trying to model, a, what, the things that cause —I have to watch my words—, the types of activities that would cause an EMP, then you basically don't want to shut down the electrical grid of a city, and so you use a shield for that. That's the typical use-case for this type of RF shield. What we're trying to do is shrink that and make it portable. So we have a shoebox-size, or in this case, because I can put that in my suitcase, a smartphone size, you walk in the room, a meeting room, you've got maybe a room full of well-trusted journalists, or enterprise managers and you want to protect your secrets from attacks, you simply put the device in the Monero Shield, and it blocks all RF, and you can have your meeting. So that's just one of the use-cases for the new Monero Shield.

Let's see, I'm going to do this kind of a whirlwind, quite fast, because we don't have much time and the very last device may be the most important. I don't even have a sample of this, it's at the printers right now, it's made of steel, ANC1430 steel is the type. Because of its electrical characteristics, it has less chrome. And this is basically a paper wallet but it's able to withstand high temperatures, fires, buildings, you drop it in the bottom of the ocean and you can possibly locate it with a magnetometer or something like that. So it's a very reliable type of passive wallet, useful for backing up your smartphone wallet, wherever you have your wallet you might want to have a passive wallet on top of that, like a paper wallet [inaudible] and Monero Metal is our new device to provide that. 

I think most people already know what the Kastelo wallet is but here's kind of a update on the status. I have a couple devices working here, let's see if I can, there we go, and then I will zoom in. There we go, nice and close. And so, just a quick rundown of what the features are at the time. It does create a full Monero wallet but it doesn't support the features that you might typically expect like verifying spending, sending up across a network to the blockchain, and so on. So, let me try that one instead, this one has a battery, it's made for presentation purposes. And I need to. So we're not going to be able to. Yeah, the enclosure's not allowing me to push the button, unfortunately, but, so this is the enclosed wallet. I'll have to show you how it works after the presentation.

So, I'll give you a quick demonstration of how we developed this. It's a program called [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), and it's all on GitHub so you can download the sources, and, this is my presentation computer, I don't really know how to use Windows. What is this? Okay. Anyway, so this is KiCad, this is a schematic, this is describing the different communications between all of the chips and traces. And, for hardware engineers the schematic is kind of the first —first, how do you do this?— the first means of understanding what the circuits do, what the device does. This is the biggest chip, in the middle, it's a ARM cortex M3 ISA instruction set architecture. And we're doing some things with the second platform which I'll talk about later. So that's the schematic, and here's the layout. This is what the actual board looks like. So, if I take this and zoom in a bit, this is the same thing, if you look at those circles there those are the mount holes to come onto the enclosure. And we go back to the camera, and now I'll just move that over, this is the circuit board which is inside, and you can see those same three mount holes. Right, so the only thing missing on the layout diagram is the display, which is not relevant for laying out parts. Anyway so that's how that looks, backside is like this, made a note about the USB pins having a problem on that particular platine, PCB.

Okay, so that's KiCad, that's what we're using to develop the hardware with, and we're doing [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) for the mechanical engineering. Let me show that. So, if you're wondering how this thing is made with the hole there, the USB-C connector that's inside, that's made with KiCad. So, here we have the enclosure, and if I just drop this then I can just kind of spin it around. This is a 3d modeling for a FDM a fused deposition modeling printer or a 3d printer. And we make some changes when we send this to the plastics manufacturing for shooting ABS or PC polycarbonate plastic, but mostly this is the FDM. I can't, why can't I rotate this? That's not rotating too well, I don't know why. Yeah I just, is that frozen? I think Windows is kind of, whatever. So anyways that's the polycarbonate, we're probably going to do a polycarbonate ABS hybrid enclosure. We had a survey, not sure if you all noticed about a month ago we had the first survey to ask the community what color the enclosure should be. We can do things with multiple colors when we're printing them individually, on a piece by piece case, basis, like this. But when we do real, professional enclosure engineering we're going to have to choose a single type of plastic and a single enclosure color. And it was decided to do an orange translucent color, so sixty percent opacity, or, transparency. And the top plate will be clear like this for a number of reasons, first of all, so that we can have a very simplified design for the display that shines through. If the top plate was, for example, black color or orange, you wouldn't see the display. We would have to cut a hole out and do some more engineering. So we're just trying to keep things down to a minimum complexity. And all the other sides will be orange. And the design is actually at the manufacturer right now. They've asked for some modifications due to the draft angle, and due to the supports for the PCB inside which caused the molten plastic to not pop out of the mold. So we're going to make those changes and send it in another week or two, and possibly the first T1, that's the test round of a small batch of about a hundred enclosures might be in our hands in a couple of months, maybe even a month and a half.

So, that's the status of the enclosure and the Kastelo hardware wallet. We do have, so, I will say I have some sample developer kits, they're blue colored, and I have at least three. I'd like to give those out, I'm actually very enthusiastic about putting those in your hands. So, if you think you can do something meaningful with it, like outside of, except of, you know, taking a look at it once on the plane and then you get home and it stays in a drawer. Please, if you can do something meaningful with the wallet, then come up to me after the presentation or, even better, catch me some other place, I'll be sitting in the crowd, and I'll give you one a developer kit. It looks exactly like this, whoops, you can't see that, it looks exactly like this but it's blue color. So, it has an enclosure, buttons, just no batteries inside. Right, so that would be very nice of you to test that device out, maybe contribute something. 

Yeah, when we're doing PCB engineering, some hardware theory that we pay attention to is that each of our devices has an MCU, we're not doing much with MPU's, or high-power forty-watt TDP type platforms. We're doing everything very low power, so even battery-powered is an option. So that's what MCU stands for, a microcontroller unit. Lots with ARM-based microcontrollers, cortex M3, M4, but we're considering other platforms, which is another slide, maybe do some RISC-V. 

We think of program storage, how much we need, but what type of storage that is as well. If it's secure storage it means that the physical chip has probably a mesh which makes it very difficult to decapsulate with sulfuric acid, these types of security features. 

Debug interfaces, typical is JTAG or SWD single-wire debug, so that's how you actually get the firmware onto the chip because the chip doesn't have a hard drive, it doesn't have any external storage. So we're using the debug interface to get information in and out during development. The input and output is important to keep in mind when we're doing things like buttons and displays, but USB communications as well. There's been requests for NFC and some radio, which we're kind of, we won't be doing that in the beginning for the risk that it carries. We don't have our wonderful shield working yet so we want to stay away from RF communications, if possible, at least in the very beginning. 

Some of our colleagues like Mathieu Stephan from the [Mooltipass](https://www.mymooltipass.com/), he does excellent work. If you haven't, I have a Mooltipass if you're interested in knowing how a Multipass stores and defends your secrets, which is the same thing as a hardware wallet, it just will defend your passwords instead of your cryptocurrency keys. And he does great work. His next version of the Mooltipass is going to have RF in it, so we're kind of, maybe following in his steps, but we haven't done any RF yet. The input and output is limited to cable-based in our situation. 

On-chip security is always important, especially if you're doing ED25519 and Edwards key Montgomery Curve type things because not much off-the-counter hardware supports this, but we're seeing some new platforms come out that we may be able to use in the future. I even have, I have one to show I think.

So the last of our Monero hardware landscape status report relates to badges. We're doing a number of badges for different group's events and so I don't want to be too specific but I will give a preview of one of the badges that we're working on. And it looks like this and it's called Monero Rising. So, I'm not sure, I have so many prototypes that I don't even know what they all do anymore. Let's just cross our fingers and find out what this one does. They all have batteries, so I think they turn on. So this one probably, okay this one, this one, yeah, this one intends to test the input, so it has capacitive touch sensors at the bottom. You can see those three right there. And the intention of this firmware, it doesn't look very good, it does almost nothing, but if you touch one of the sensors then a second light comes on. And so that's kind of the state of progress where we're at right now. This should be ready in about a month. And we have some time to develop the firmware. I do have some samples of these as well. I'd really appreciate your help in developing some firmware for this, animations, and input sequences feature that you'd like to see in this device. So that's the one that tests the input. So we have a couple of others here. Is that box empty? Yep. This one probably, okay so this one tests every single one of the sixty-seven LEDs that are on there. We want to make sure that we can activate or turn one on individually and turn it off. We've had some problems, in fact, that's the reason that we have all of these wires going everywhere because the problems that we had were that parts of this array were lighting up when they shouldn't. So this is simply a correction of that. And as you see, all of the lights independently light up, that's really boring. So let's see what this one does, and, this one's a different color, which, I think I canceled this color, I don't know. If you like colors just please tell me because we're probably going to do only white on this. Right, anyway so this turns all of the lights on in a very inefficient sequence so that's why you can see that it's kind of going from that way to that way. Right and this is what the panels look like, this is actually what happens when we get them back from the printers, from the PCB, the printed circuit board fabricators before we assemble. 

And, something I'd like to point out because it's kind of a pioneering piece of work, is that we're doing multiple nested footprints. So these two things here, I probably have to zoom in to that, you can see like one row of contacts inside another. And what we're doing there is trying to create one PCB that can support two different parts which are selectively populated. So obviously, if I put a chip that is contacting with all the outside legs, it's going to cover the board there. I can't put another chip underneath it, it's a selective mutual exclusion, but that can support two different chips. We kind of got that idea from Wixxer, the designer of the Defcon badges. And yeah that's one of the pioneering features. There's a couple other things. This will have a lithium-ion battery that's rechargeable as well. And if you look on the side it has a USB-C connector, which is kind of cool. Fortunately, no data going in and out of that. So that's the Monero Rising badge. We'll probably have some cool lanyards to go with that. Focus, please. Yeah, and, there's a couple other badges in the works, but there's not that much time, and I don't think I'm going to do a demonstration of how to engineer the firmware because I don't know if I have VSCode on here or [PlatrformIO](https://platformio.org/). What do you think, do I have this? This is the presentation computer so it's not the one I use for, no I don't have PlatformIO. I don't know how we're going to do a workshop if there's going to be any time at all for that here, it's going to be spontaneous if we do, but I have some badges as well. Let's see, this is what they look like. So if you'd like to take a shot at engineering some firmware I have not only a badge for you, that's what they look like, they're all assembled, they work, and I'll give you a battery that you have to stick on the back yourself. Then there's some programming cables which I've prepared in my lab. I'm not going to take them out but you can kind of see there's some cables in there and some programming devices. You put that in your USB connector and then you can program the badges that way. They're primitive devices in which means they don't have a USB circuit onboard. You can't plug them with a USB connector into your computer and have data communications, so you can't program them that way in the traditional way that you would with an Arduino or something. They're just too primitive for that, they're very low cost. But I will help you if you want to experiment by giving you one of these cables, and that way you can program them. 

So that was the Monero Rising badge. These, yeah, these CR2052 batteries didn't work out so we're going to do lithium polymer ion. On this badge, we have three different interesting sensors. I already demonstrated the capacitive touch sensor, which basically uses the ground in your body to decide if you're touching the sensor with your finger or not. 

There's a couple others. There's an ALS, an ambient light sensor which is on the front. I won't even try to show it, it's way too small. It's like about one-fourth the size of a rice kernel, okay. You can't see it. But you can feel it with your finger and it's on the front and basically gives you a voltage. If you put it in a light, a strong light, like in the sunlight, it will give you maybe a high voltage. And if you put it in a closet which is dark or a suitcase which has no light inside, then it will read close to zero. And that's a key idea, a suitcase which is dark, and you have your badge in the suitcase, and it's turned on and reading light. Now, what would happen if an evil maid opened your suitcase to look for your whatever secrets and private things, and light streamed into your suitcase, maybe you're getting the idea that this badge device can actually support an intrusion detection application. So that's one of the firmware features that we will have if we get that far if we all cooperate and collaborate and actually work together and maybe somebody can help by testing or, yeah, making some firmware that supports like an evil maid detector attack or something. So that's kind of in the future but I'm really hopeful that we have some interesting things like that. 

Another possible feature would be the party mode where everyone in a club or at least the ones wearing the badge will have their animations, their flashes, whatever their badges are doing, synchronized according to the music, the loud drumbeats or whatever, the typical type of music you have at a party or in a club atmosphere. And the way that we do that is that we have a microphone on the badge. So, and you can desolder the microphone as well, it's relatively easy to remove, I'll even help you with that. I know that some people are very averse to this type of light sensor, audio sensor, but I will reassure you that the microphone can only output voltages. So it's not capturing waveforms. It can't do anything like store, what, a dog barking or your voice, or any kind of sound in its environment, it can only real-time tell you exactly at that microsecond what the audio volume that it's detecting is in the form of a voltage. Okay, so what that can tell you is that if there's a loud drum beating on that one microsecond, and if you detect that, and you have firmware that supports something like a party mode you could have the entire row of Monero party individuals kind of lighting up all at once. So that's kind of another idea which may or may not come into the firmware, I hope it does. But those are the different sensors on the device. 

We do have some ideas in the future which are going to take some time to fully research but for ECDSA and maybe Schnorr algorithm digital signatures, we're looking at a brand new chip which isn't even on the market yet, and I'm really hoping they don't require an NDA to obtain these, an NDA is a non-disclosure agreement because we would be forced to reject that hardware if they did. But it's called the NXP SE050, it has some other names as well, it's early on enough that their marketing is not stable, but they support Brainpool and a couple of other curves and they support the Montgomery and Edwards curves, ED25519, the one that we care so much about. So that's interesting for us. Cryptocell is an architecture from ARM, directly from ARM, which is integrated in a few different hardware products like the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840. We've been looking at that chip for a long time. Secure boot is on our roadmap with the CEC1702, we actually have a hardware wallet that integrates that. And what I am actually very intrigued about but we haven't had time to research it fully is a RISC-V architecture. 

So I'm going to end the presentation by showing that chip because I just came back from China and met the manufacturers. They gave me some preview samples. This is really messy, sorry, clean up this mess [laughs]. Sorry and this is what a RISC-V chip looks like. RISC-V is hot stuff because you actually own the hardware, there's no black boxes, there's no secrets, it's an open-source hardware. Let's see how well we can see that. That's probably as close as I can get. So we have a BGA package on the bottom, those are all little balls that contact with your PCB, and this one is called a Kendryte K210. So if you get excited about hardware, then that's why I'm ending with the picture of a chip, and I would invite questions, and as well if you want a wallet then come up, I'm sorry not a wallet, a Kastelo device [laughter], and have some badges as well.

Any questions?

[Applause]

That's not a question. [laughter]

Okay.

Having just listened to the previous talk, my question would be, and this is thinking out loud, how difficult it would be to create a miniaturized Geiger counter that would measure background radiation as a source of randomness for a hardware wallet?

Well, I think it would be very difficult because the devices I've seen, the sensors that measure this type of radiation in this spectrum are tubes. They look like, they're as big as your thumb. So you'd have to somehow secure that with some type of adhesive onto the hardware wallet. So my impression, not having too much experience with Geiger counters, is that it would be too difficult because of the format and the size of the sensor itself. It's obviously a very good idea, maybe for other security devices. And this same idea, if you rephrase it, something like instead of sensing radiation in the environment, sensing temperature, movement, acceleration, all of these different things and you can make a mixture of these benchmarks. But it's, you're on the right track for trying to develop a nonce using a good amount of chaos.

Any other questions?

Oh, yeah. What controller are you using on the Monero badge?

There are two controllers right now because we have two formats, two, anyway and one of them, the one that I just showed you is a STM32F405RETG, but it's not the one that we're actually going to support in the future, that's a L. It's an STM32L486, whatever I think RGT6, and so that's a low power variant of it because we are doing some experimentation with batteries we want to do some low power. I'm sorry the other one is a microchip CEC1702 which gives us secure boot, immutable boot, and a couple other features. I think ED25519 is built-in as well.

And are you programming that through JTAG?

Yes, the, well, we're programming that through JTAG but we have a USB DFU, device firmware update over the USB port because all of these microcontrollers actually the STM supports USB natively and the CEC we're adding a Sylabs USB circuit to it. So that's how we're doing that.

Great, thank you very much, Michael.

You're welcome.

[Applause]
