Thank you all so much for having me and thanks for Brandon and the Monero folks, for inviting me to do this. 

So today I'm going to talk to you about the case for electronic cash and how we're talking about it in Washington DC. 

The first thing I want to tell you is a little bit about Coin Center. I'm the executive director of Coin Center. Coin Center's been around for about five years, we're based in DC. And we're an independent non-profit that's focused on the public policy issues that affect cryptocurrencies and open, permissionless blockchain networks like Monero, Bitcoin, Zcash, Ethereum, the like. We basically do three things. We do education. We do public policy research, and we do advocacy. So education's where we spend a lot of our time, and what that means is making sure that policy makers, and that means members of congress, their staff understand this technology right. They have a question about what it is, how it works, why it's important, we can answer it. And we do that through one on one briefings, one to many briefings, we have testified at almost every hearing that congress has held on cryptocurrency since twenty thirteen, even before the center existed, somebody from Coin Center has been testifying and doing that. As we have these conversations, inevitably we get questions that we don't have the answer to, and typically that's because, it's not a question about how the technology works, which we can answer or find somebody who can answer that, but it's a question of law, and typically where technology has outpaced the law and now there's a gap, and regulators and policy-makers are going to want to fill it. And so that's where we engage in our policy research. We develop policy thinking that helps regulators fill those gaps, because they're going to fill it whether we come up with ideas or not, and what we want to do is make sure that they can meet their ends, while preserving, as much as possible, and the freedom to innovate. 

And then the last thing we do is we advocate, we lobby. We lobby for our preferred solutions. 
An important thing to note is we're not a trade association. We don't have members. We don't represent any companies or any particular persons. We represent ourselves. So if you're familiar with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, what they are to the internet, we aspire to be for open blockchain, permissionless networks. So that's who we are and what we do, and we've spent the last five years focused mainly on consumer protection issues, which means state money transmission licensing, banking licensing and stuff like that, securities regulation because those have been the things that have been sort of most pressing for regulators, also tax. But now we are focusing on privacy more and more. And over the last three months we've published several reports focused on privacy which I encourage you to go online at [coincenter.org](https://coincenter.org) and check that out  where we've been talking more and more about privacy. And what I'm going to do today is sort of give you a presentation that sort of presents these papers and presents for you the way we talk about privacy to folks in Washington DC, to policy makers and regulators. And the way that we do that is through the lense of cash. We are making a moral case for cash that cash is necessary for an open, liberal society which folks in DC care about still despite what you may have heard. And we also make sort of a legal case and a constitutional case for why electronic cash is something that's constitutionally protected. 
So that's how we talk about it, and that's what I'm going to walk you through today.

So the first thing is, as I say, we talk about cash and the importance of cash. And people often, when they, probably not in this crowd, but when people hear about cash they just think of money. They think these things are synonyms, and so the first thing we have to explain is that, no, cash isn't just money. Cash has a very particular meaning. So, cash is a bearer instrument, so you've got it and you can use it.   Cash is person to person, so you can give it to somebody else, and when you do, they have it and you don't, and that's how you use it. 
And so that makes it, number one, permissionless. There's no intermediary, there's nobody between you that you have to seek permission, you can just hand it to somebody and you've used it. So it's permissionless, and it's censorship resistant, because, again, there's nobody who can stop you from using it because it's bearer, right. And that makes it person to person, and that also makes it private. So, there's no reason why anybody necessarily has to know of any transaction except for parties to the transaction. Indeed, maybe even only one person. So if you drop a hundred dollar bill into a donation box at a church, you're the only one who knows that that transaction happened. So those are, you know, when we talk about cash, that's what we're talking about. And what we're seeing is, that, increasingly, the more developed countries are, the more cashless they are becoming. So we see this very prominently in nordic countries. So Sweden is fast becoming a cashless society. According to it's central bank, cash transactions accounted for only two percent of all, the value of all payments made in twenty fifteen, and that figure is expected to drop to just zero point five percent by twenty twenty. And there's a majority of bank branches in Sweden right now that no longer keep cash on hand. And it's very rare to find, increasingly rare to find ATM's in Sweden. And it's again similar to countries like Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Finland. I was just in Norway and, yeah, I can attest to you, I didn't even take any paper notes, American or European to Norway my entire time that I was there. South Korea targets, has twenty twenty as a target date for phasing out all paper notes and coins. And increasingly you have sort of anti-cash campaigns that are both corporate and government. So on the corporate side, you can imagine, it's mainly the payment processors who profit from every transaction that gets made through an intermediary. So Visa, Mastercard, they will run campaigns, advertising campaigns aimed at consumers with different kinds of incentives to get you to switch to you know, only using debit cards and credit cards, but more importantly they will go and have campaigns aimed at merchants and vendors, where they will go to a restaurant, and say, we will pay you, and we will give you a free point of sale system and we will give you monetary incentives if you agree to make your establishment cash-free, no cash. And so everything has to be going through our system. And of course governments also increasingly would like to see a cashless society, number one because they feel they can better address illicit use of cash that way which is kind of like using a hammer to you know kill an ant. But also I think they're, if you can get rid of cash and all money is basically deposits, the central bank is going to have better control over it's monetary policy, you can do things like negative rates. So that's going to be of interest to them. 

China is really remarkable in this story because it has become really increasingly cashless in a very short period of time. The move away from cash in China happened in just a few years. While cash accounted for ninety six percent of payments in twenty twelve, today that number's below fifteen percent. And as of twenty eighteen more than a half billion Chinese use mobile payments. And so that's basically Tencents WeChat Pay and AliPay which are the dominant payment platforms, and they have a combined market share of ninety two percent. And so, you know, and as more and more commerce happens online we're only going to see you know, less and less use of cash, and at some point banks may just choose to just stop making it.

So, when you have a cashless society that is going to be, necessarily, an intermediated society. And I don't, you know, usually with a policy maker or a layperson I usually have to explain what this means. I don't have to do that to this audience I don't think. Obviously, if there's no cash, that is, bearer and peer to peer, all transactions must go through an intermediary. And when that happens it means that the money that you're using is no longer permissoinless, right. Which means that it's no longer censorship resistant. Somebody in between can decide, number one we're not going to give you an account, so you can't participate. Or we can say this transaction we're not going to allow because we don't like it. It's also not private. So in a cashless society, every transaction that you do is necessarily always surveiled. And I think people just don't stop to think about that. 

And again, China is just the perfect example of this, where you go there today and you look really odd in some of the major metropolitan areas if you try to use paper money. What you do if you do go there, what you'll see is that there are QR codes everywhere that basically allow you to pay with AliPay. So if you want to pay for lunch this is how you do it. Okay. If you want to buy some coconut water from a vendor off the street you're going to use a QR code with AliPay.

This is a street musician, a street musician who is doing a performance and when he's done he puts up his QR code so people can tip him. Right, so even busters use AliPay. 
This is a bike share, so you want to rent a bike, you unlock it using AliPay. If you want to get a fee for service medical scan, you use AliPay. This is a, sort of an automated lending library where you can borrow a book by paying. Again, just a QR code, that's what you use to pay. 
And so this is great, because it's super efficient and everybody has it, and it's a, you know, great network effect. But that means that AliPay knows where you are with your bike, what you read, if you're sick, right. And this also means that so does the Chinese government, because there really is very little distinction between the Chinese government and AliPay and WeChat Pay. 

And as you all probably know, something that we sometimes have to explain to folks but I think you all probably know. In China,  government authorities are developing a social credit system, that they're basically going to use to create a database of all citizens, and citizens are going to get a rating based on their civic virtue. And so it's going to look at things like are you getting traffic fines, are you returning your library books on time, what are your grades in school, are you jaywalking etcetera etcetera. And one of the inputs that goes into this social credit score is going to be what you buy, right, and how responsible you are with your money, and what your credit score is, and whether you're being, you know, civically virtuous according to the state with what you're buying. 

So here's a director of AliPay, giving an interview, where he's talking about their rollout of their, basically their own credit system where they're basically doing consumer credit scoring which, and then that in turn becomes part of the social credit score. And he says someone who plays video games for ten hours a day, for example, would be considered an idle person. And someone who frequently buys diapers would be considered as probably a parent, who, on balance, is more likely to have a sense of responsibility. And they can tell this by what you're purchasing, or your purchasing habits and your transactions. 

If you have low social credit score, that could mean for you slower internet speeds, restricted access to restaurants, nightclubs or golf courses, and even the removal of the right to travel freely abroad, or even internally. Today there are all kinds of people who cannot travel internally within a certain area because they have a low social score. And again they can be controlled because if you have to use an intermediated money to get on the train, and you're not allowed to a train ticket to a certain, you know, beyond a certain area, this can all be automated through the money because it's all intermediated. And, by the way, one thing that's interesting, it's not interesting it's horrifying, is, your social credit score isn't only effected by your own activity, it's also effected by the activity of your friends and family. So you have an incentive to make sure that your friends and family are following the rules, or to at least not be friends with people who have a low social score. 

And again this is all tied in through social media as well. 
So, ultimately, in an intermediated society, your account can be locked, you can basically be locked out of society, and that's a very bad thing. 

What we want, however, is an open society. And, an open society is the opposite of an authoritarian state like China. And the hallmark of an open society is a free competition of ideas, right, that drives progress. And in an open society, challenges to the status quo thinking are not only tolerated, they are valued and protected. An open society works, however, only if individuals are free to engage in critical thinking, to develop, communicate and critique, and accept or reject ideas. That in turn requires freedom of thought and expression, and association. Which is why open societies tend to be liberal democracies that guarantee civil liberties under the rule of law. 
And it's important for us, when we're talking to folks in DC about this to draw that contrast, right, between what we don't want, which is something like China, and an open society, which, folks in government, especially folks in law enforcement and national security, they are buy and large doing what they do for a living because they care about liberal values. They care about the constitution and the values the constitution stands for, and they want to see an open society. There's a balance between liberty and order, and I think a lot of folks who are in law enforcement and national security and policy makers, because it's their job to keep order and sort of have more, go more toward the order side of the ledger, but I think you can make them recognize that there's a balance there, and you have to be careful that when getting order that you don't give up too much liberty. And this is why it's important to point this out to them. And what we explained is that privacy is essential to freedom of though, to freedom of speech, and to association, not only because it prevents would-be censors from discovering thought crimes, but also because of the chilling effects that come from knowing that one is being watched all of the time, especially by an authority. 

So, what we explain is that cash, or, sorry, I should say a cashless society is an intermediated society, an intermediated society is not compatible with an open society, right. An open society requires freedom of thought, expression, and assembly. And those freedoms require privacy and autonomy. 
And so, let me give you just two examples of how intermediation is undermining these values. 

So, the first example is something that happened with Target. This was about four years ago, I want to say five years ago, the New York Times ran a really extensive profile of their, of Target's marketing, that uses statistics, right, so they hired a bunch of quants to help them with their marketing. And so they developed some really interesting ways to market to folks, and they had one anecdote in that story which is really, really crystalizes what intermediation means for autonomy and for privacy. 
And it's this, it's that there was this guy who came into a Target store very angry very mad, and he wanted to talk to the manager and the manager came out, and he had flyers, target mailers that had been sent to his daughter who was in high school. And he was like, you know, these are all mailers that were sent to her for cribs and baby clothes, and she's, you know seventeen, are you trying, you know, what is Target, what is this, are you trying to suggest she get pregnant, what is this. And the manager didn't know what this was and was very sorry and apologized and you know he went away. The manager called him a couple days later to just apologize again and you know just talk to him and the guy said, you know, I owe you an apology. He said things have been going on in my house that I wasn't aware of and she's due in September. 

So, how did Target know before she had told her father that she was pregnant? And the answer is, is that when you shop at Target you are assigned a unique identifier. And that unique identifier, and this is not optional, you don't opt into this right, if you use a credit card, your credit card number is going to be used to basically identify you. And then your purchasing habits are going to be tracked. And what Target did is that it basically had a maternity, like a maternity club for women who wanted to sign up and get discounts on maternity stuff. And so they knew the shopping patterns of people who they knew were pregnant, and then they just mapped those onto the broader population of folks and so they could identify not just who was pregnant but when they were probably due. 
And you know, one thing that was really remarkable was the statistician who was interviewed by the New York Times, and, by the way he was interviewed for the story and he was very forthcoming with, you know he was very excited about what he had built, because what he had built could basically learn a lot about people. And later I think, basically Target's PR folks got a sense of what the New York Times story was really about and he stopped cooperating with that. But one of the things that he explained to the New York Times before that happened was, that the Target executives who came to him with the problem, the way they put it to him was, Hey, is there a way, and this was verbatim, if we wanted to figure out if a customer was pregnant, even if she didn't want us to know, can you do that? Right, and so, look I mean it's easy to say "What's the big deal here?", transactions are happening publicly, Target is just taking note of stuff thats happening publicly. 
Well, the problem is that again you don't have to consent to be tracked this way. And the fact that they were trying to hide it, I think kind of tells me that they knew they were doing something wrong. Right, so this is really an affront to dignity and to autonomy becuase again she was deprived of her being able to tell her father herself, on her own terms. Right. So how could she have prevented being tracked? There's only one way, she could have paid in cash. Right, if she had paid in cash for her transactions, that's how she could have prevented this from happening. And we really can't just get rid of cash if we don't want this to happen.

The other example I want to share with you has to do with the National Rifle Association. Now, say what you will, you know, you might like guns, you might not like guns. The National Rifle Association, at the end of the day what is it? It is a association of individuals, right, so freedom of assembly. It's an association of individuals who come together to do what, to excersize their first amendment rights because all the NRA does is that they publish advocacy materials. They also have classes and things like that, but what they do mostly is publish advocacy materials and advocate and speak in defense of the second amendment, which is another right guaranteed... And so that's what they do they excersize their constitutional rights to defend further constitutional rights. 
So here's what happened with the NRA, so essentially after there was a school shooting, and in response to that, New York state governor Andrew Cuomo basically directed his regulators to make sure that the NRA was shut out from any sort of financial institution. And so let me read you from the press release that New York state put out, it said, the headline was Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today directed the Department of Financial Services to urge insurance companies, New York state chartered banks, and other financial service companies licensed in New York to review any relationships they may have with the National Rifle Association and other similar organizations. Upon this review the companies are encouraged to consider whether such ties harm their coporate reputations and jeapordize public safety. 
And if it wasn't clear enough, financial services superintendent Maria Vullo made it clear later in the same press release, and this is a quote from her "DFS urges all insurance companies and banks doing business in New York to join the companies who have already discontinued their arrangements with the NRA". So this is remarkable right. This is a governor telling financial intermediaries over which he has serious power that they must cut off one of his political opponents, not because that opponent broke any law but because it engages in speech and advocacy that is at odds with the governors views, right. And think about it, if this is successful, then the NRA is just the first one, tomorrow it could be in Alabama or Georgia it could be Planned Parenthood where the governor says I don't like them, cut them off. And if the NRA is cut off from having a bank account, and we live in a society without any cash, they're gone. They can't operate. It's a death sentence. And so, in a world that is increasingly intermediated and increasingly cashless, we have to have electronic cash, right. Because if cash is essential to an open society and society is going cashless, we need to have electronic cash. 

And that is where I'm out of time, and I was going to talk to you about the law, but maybe I can do that in, later, you guys can come up and ask me any questions you want, and with that I'll say thank you.
