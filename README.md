## Translations

Please review the translations tips (standardized terms) we expect everyone to follow: [Tips for Monero translators](https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/monero-translations/blob/master/translation-tips.md).

Follow this instructions (if you are not familiar with Github, check out this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)):

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. The directory `en` has all the latest documents.
3. If you are working on a new language, add a `subfolder` for your language in the `/translations` folder (use [country codes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Country_Codes) for the `subfolders`). Copy the .md files you are going to translate from the `en` folder and paste it in the `subfolder` you just created. Use the correct folders for locating your work.
4. **File Names & Formats**:
 - File names should be language specific, e.g. `patents_en.md` is the English file -> `patents_fr.md` if the French file.
 - All the translated files should be in .md format. `Md` stands for `markdown`, `markdown` is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's really easy to use and you can use any text editor to add text. Need help about mastering markdown format? [Here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a tutorial.
5. When saving changes, remember to add a message to the commit with the **document's name, language, and a small description of your work** (e.g. **_"Quickfacts fr translation"_**, **_"Missing punctuation donttalk PSA pt_Br"_**, etc.).
6. When making a Pull Request (PR), remember to put a title that identifies your work, e.g. _**"How to Buy" - Chinese translation**_, _**"Monero Paper Wallet Primer" 'fr' translation**_.
